## About

This project demonstrates how to create a hexagon-based transition effect between two images using WebGPU and Three.js Shading Language (TSL). The effect features animated hexagon tiles with noise-based distortion, smooth blending, and customizable transition controls.

This is a personal practice project for learning WebGPU and TSL (Three.js Shading Language).
